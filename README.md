Hi there, this is the first iteration of the Hourly Foxes Wallpaper Plugin for KDE.

At this time, the only thing here is the default template for Wallpaper Plugins for Plasma w/ QML.

Expect a new fox every hour on the hour. :)

Roadmap:
1. Configure Twitter load request script
2. Allow users to specify Twitter handle to follow.
3. Optimize
